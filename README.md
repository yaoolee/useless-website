# 🏆 Can You Reach the End?  
A Useless (But Fun!) Front-End Challenge

---

## 🚀 About

Welcome to the most delightfully useless web challenge you’ll ever try!  
**Can You Reach the End?** is a playful one-page site where every button click creates more buttons, and—just to make things harder—scrolling is upside-down!
